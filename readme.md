`./union.sh` combines all of the databases into one database, `/tmp/logs.db`.

`./analyze.r` does all of the analysis after the database has been created.

## Temporary file storage
I configure my computers such that `/tmp` is a ram disk, so I'm storing
temporary files in `/tmp`. (This makes things fast.)
